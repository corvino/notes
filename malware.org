** Launch Items and Login Items

Some common (library) locations to check:

- =/Library/PrivilegedHelpterTools=
- =/Library/LaunchAgents=
- =/Library/LaunchDaemons=
- =~/Library/LaunchAgents=

Scanning with KnockKnock is a good way to get a list of all of these.
** Cleaning up installed software

Use /*Manage*/ from the /*Storage*/ tab on the  /*About This Mac*/ panel.
