* App bundle
 Xcode builds apps in =~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/<Name>-<guid>/Build/Products/Debug=.

Resources cane be found in =/Contents/Resources=, such as:

=~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/<Name>-<guid>/Build/Products/Debug/<Name>.app/Contents/Resources/AppIcon.icns=

** Asset Catalogs

*** assetutil

You can get info on an asset catalog with =assetutil=, for instance =assetutil --info Assets.car=.

*** Asset Catalog Tinkerer

You can examine a car file with [[https://github.com/insidegui/AssetCatalogTinkerer][Asset Catalog Tinkerer]]; install with =brew install asset-catalog-tinkerer=. Open a file with =open -a "Asset Catalog Tinkerer" Assets.car=.

** App Icon

To get dock and finder to pickup an updated icon

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \; 2>/dev/null
sudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.iconservices -exec rm -rf {} \; 2>/dev/null
sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store
#+END_SRC

Found in [[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7859795][Correct icon not showing in the dock]].
