The macOS/Homebrew Cask seems to have something wrong with path.

Looking at the browser console error messages is helpful.

Fix with:

#+BEGIN_SRC
SAGE_VENV=/Applications/SageMath-9-6.app/Contents//Frameworks/Sage.framework/Versions/9.6/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10.3
mkdir ${SAGE_VENV}/share/jupyter/nbextensions/widgets/notebook
ln -s ${SAGE_VENV}/share/jupyter/nbextensions/jupyter-js-widgets ${SAGE_VENV}/share/jupyter/nbextensions/widgets/notebook/js
#+END_SRC
