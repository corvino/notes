At coffee this morning some of were talking about books and the challenge of finding "just right" books for our kiddos. I wanted to share some resources that we got for Oliver's brother that have been useful.

The Scholastic website has curated book lists, and the ability to lookup the grade level for most books by searching for them on the Scholastic site. Some of these lists and the search can be found at https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/teaching-tools/book-lists.html.

Scholastic also has lists organized around reading levels that are not well surfaced on the site. There is a chart describing the reading levels at https://shop.scholastic.com/teachers-ecommerce/teacher/guided-reading-leveling-chart.html. I can't find a list pointing to those levels, but I've been able to find most of them:
