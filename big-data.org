** Common to DataGrip/IntelliJ Ultimate
*** You can use Driver or Driver and Data Source
Using Driver and Data Source, you have select Driver to get to Data
Source, which gets you to the same place as Data Source. Kinda. Why?
*** You can download a driver from AWS in the Redshift Console
**** Look for Connect client at the bottom of the sidebar menu
*** You want to add the com.amazon.redshift.jdbc<version>.Driver as the driver class name
*** You want PostgreSQL as the Dialect
*** Redshift is the recommended name
jdbc:redshift://p-reporting-main.ceglwjrxcc7w.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/main
