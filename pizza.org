Probably Portland too.
*** Shepherd’s Grain Flour
We were talking a bit of Pizza last night at [[http://www.cyclopsseattle.com/][Cyclops]], as you do, and the topic of flour was brought up.

If you live in the greater Seattle area, you need to go buy some [[http://www.shepherdsgrain.com/][Shepherd’s Grain]] High Gluten flour. [[https://www.smartfoodservice.com/][Cash & Carry]] has 50lb bags of it, for $21. You can't beat that price, and I've not found a better flour for use in your home oven. It makes great bread too.

We're pretty damn lucky to have this flour, take advantage of it.
