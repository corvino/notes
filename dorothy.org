Hi Nathan !
I'll just send you the referrals as they come in.
this guy seems like he could be a good fit for you :

Woody Pollock

also I would try Patti Boyle.
she is our couples therapist and is great.
I don't know if she has space

 I hear her male colleague is great too. same website...
all in West Seattle.

OK one more... in Tukwila.
I met him years ago and he was a lovely person.

if I were you I would try a 20 mns consult with all of them  ( phone or in person) and see which you feel works for you.

go back to my long message above ... re 20 mns... unless someone feels
great to you right away I would let them know you are interviewing
therapists and planning to make a decision soon. also check out their
schedules and insurance because obviously that is a factor too..
