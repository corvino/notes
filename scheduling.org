Hi Mt Rainier FC B13 Blue,

I'm working to accommodate our coach having two teams playing on this day. Would it be possible to have a later kickoff? After 2:30 PM would be great, and later is better—the other match will be 90 minutes in Lacey. We will try to get his other kickoff before 1 PM.

Thanks,
Nathan
